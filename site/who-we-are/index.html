            Andrew Boardman brings a varied background as a serial entrepreneur, manager, teacher, consultant, and financial professional. He started professional programming in high school, writing text editor software for electronic bulletin board systems. Since then he has been the tech lead for the Windows build lab, lead developer for Windows Live Messenger, worked on desktop publishing software at Quark, and co-founded five startups, and much more.

Andrew was drawn to Haskell in 2015 as the best solution to solve the truly difficult problems in computer science. Most recently he was a Haskell developer and engineering manager at SimSpace Corp., working on software for cybersecurity readiness training and testing. He is extremely excited about serving the community, and looks forward to working with everyone to address pain points and build on the language’s strengths.

            Emily Pillmore got her start on Wall St. as a consultant and financial professional, reverse engineering statistical models and providing technical audit. She started her programming career as a late bloomer at the University of Utah, learning Java and Perl. Ultimately deciding to pursue mathematics (Topology and Geometry), she found a way to combine these two loves via functional programming, and quickly changed careers to focus on Scala and Haskell in 2016. Since then, she has served as a senior engineer for Disney Streaming (working on Disney+), and as a core team member of <a href="https://kadena.io">Kadena</a>.

Emily has since developed a proclivity for OSS and community contributions, authoring or maintaining many well-known Haskell packages, contributing to Core Libraries and Haskell.org as a board member, and serving the Haskell Foundation as its first Working Group Chair. She looks forward to seeing Haskell flourish, and building some great tech that will make everyone’s Haskell experience that much better.

             Simon is a researcher at Microsoft Research in Cambridge, England, where he started in Sept 1998. He’s also an Honorary Professor of the Computing Science Department at Glasgow University, where he was a professor during 1990-1998.  Simon is interested in the design, implementation, and application of lazy functional languages. He was one of the original designers of Haskell, and much of his work is focused around the Glasgow Haskell Compiler and its ramifications. Simon is also chair of Computing at School, the group at the epicentre of the reform of the national curriculum for Computing in England. Computer science is now a foundational subject, alongside maths and natural science, that every child learns from primary school onwards.

In the late nineties Chris taught Haskell to undergraduates in UCC (Cork) and in the noughties used Haskell tools to develop key aspects of the ARMv7 architecture. Since 2013 Chris has been chief Engineer for IRIS Connect where he has overseen the development of the new IRIS Connect video platform which makes extensive use of Haskell in the back end.

            Edward is a researcher focused on AI safety at the Machine Intelligence Research Institute. He also sits on the board of the Topos Institute, promoting category theory in industry as a tool for exchanging ideas. Outside of Haskell he's worked on graphics and special effects, telecommunications, finance, linguistics, and once helped Taiwan point a big RADAR at China. Edward found Haskell in 2006 and at the time mistakenly believed all Haskellers were thoroughly fluent in category theory, so he started blogging to this imaginary audience. A few years later his work on lenses provided a more practical impetus for more folks to learn some of these ideas, closing the circle. He currently maintains well over a hundred Haskell libraries covering a rather wide swathe of topics and isn't entirely sure how he backed himself in that position.

            More often known as Bodigrim, Andrew is an extremely active Haskell community member, library author and maintainer, speaker and mentor. He has made strides towards cleaning out backlogs for bytestring, text, unix, random, and vector, which were previously stalled. Andrew holds a PhD degree for contributions to the theory of the Riemann zeta-function and develops a range of mathematical packages with a focus on performance.
